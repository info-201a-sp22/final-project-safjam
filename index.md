### Purpose
Our project focuses on the environmental impact of electric vehicles. As global warming becomes an increasingly prevalent issue and gasoline becomes an increasingly limited fuel-source, we are concerned with whether the next lead of fuel is to be electricity. We aim to ask how the number of electric vehicles fluctuate over time, which will help us predict how and when electric vehicles will take over normal cars.  We are also curious to see what the most popular model of electric vehicle is to predict which brand will become industry leaders in establishing electric vehicles. This suggests to us people's favorites for car brands and will allow us to dig deeper into looking for answers why. In addition, we are also interested in determining the most efficient electric vehicles based on electric range. Electric range is the measurement of how far a vehicle can travel purely on its own electrical charge. We predict that cars that can manage to travel longer distance will be more popular since it can be more reliable. With these findings, we aim to make predictions that will be able to help citizens pick and choose the best vehicle that electric-efficient, all while making contributions to making our earth a safer place.

### Questions

The role of vehicles and fuel emissions in climate change has been gaining increasing attention over the past years. Through our analysis we aim to answer the following questions:

* **What are the most efficient electric vehicles based on electric range?**

* **How does the amount of electric vehicles with CAFV vary based on the city?**

* **What are the dominating vehicle models throughout Washington state?**

We ask such questions because as technology advances and engineers develop more electric vehicles to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions, itâ€™s important to remember that these vehicles still require lots of other energy to function, if not gasoline. Thus, with this project, we will be identifying and collecting data to demonstrate whether electric vehicles are a benefit or harm to the state of Washington.

### The Dataset

In order to answer these questions, we will be using data about electric vehicles in Washington State collected by the DOL. Our data comes from [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2), sourced from the U.S. Government's open data resource called Data.gov.

### Limitations

One problem with this dataset is that the 'Electric Range' feature (indicating the distance the vehicle can travel) is no longer maintained, so although some vehicles have data expressing this information, many others do not. Along the same lines, the 'Field Electric Utility' feature (indicating the electric retail service of the vehicle's registered location) was added almost 2 years after this set's initial collection, meaning there is more missing information. A further limitation to this new 'Field Electric Utility' feature is that there's only about a month's worth of information for us to currently see. The inconsistency with the missing data here is a major drawback since there is more information we would need to research and match directly with the data we do have. Additionally, many of these features have been manually inputted, such as the Electric Range of a vehicle, so there is room for human error. Another issue that we face is that the dataset does not provide the registration date, so we cannot track the registration of models over a time frame.
