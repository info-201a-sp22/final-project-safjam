## Conclusion

The aim of the analysis was to answer three main questions:

### What are the most efficient electric vehicles based on electric range?

Through our visualization about electric efficiency we were able to gain insight into electric range across time and car models:

* The earliest electric vehicle was the Dodge Caravan in 1993, with an electric range of 80. Moreover, *Tesla* has 5 electric vehicles recorded in the data set, with the **most electric efficient** model being the *Model S* with an electric range of **337**. The closest competitor to TESLA is the Chevrolet Bolt EV made in 2017with an electric range of 238. 

### How does the amount of electric vehicles with CAFV vary based on the city?

The bar plot shows that there are **more** electric vehicles that are **CAFV-eligible than not eligible** in all cities.

* There are some cities -- like **Olympia, WA** -- that have a larger proportion of vehicles that aren’t eligible for CAFV compared to other cities. This could be because Olympia perhaps has more drivers with hybrid vehicles that require gasoline or diesel. It’s also important to note that the chart also shows that a large portion of registered vehicles are categorized as “unknown” because of the low battery range in the vehicle. Thus, we cannot definitively say that Olympia, WA has a larger percentage of non-CAFV vehicles, but we can make assumptions based on the data we have. 

Regardless, it seems like a **majority of registered electric vehicles are CAFV-eligible** which is good for our environment.


### What are the dominating vehicle models throughout Washington state?

In the top 15 counties, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV's) show more popularity than Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV's). From these vehicles, the top 5 dominating models were:

1. Tesla Model 3
2. Tesla Model Y
3. Nissan Leaf
4. Tesla Model S
5. Tesla Model X

This concludes that **Tesla's dominate the EV population in Washington state.**

* **

Overall, this project allows for Washington state car owners to make more informed decisions what vehicle type they choose to purchase and to identify trends in electric vehicle ownership geographically. Additionally, this analysis may be used by policy makers to determine how Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility can be improved and by car manufacturers to better understand consumer trends in Washington.
