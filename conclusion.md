# Conclusion

The aim of the analysis was to answer three main questions:

* **What are the most efficient electric vehicles based on electric range?**

Through our visualization about electric efficiency we were able to gain insight into electric range across time and car models:

The earliest electric vehicle was the Dodge Caravan in 1993, with an electric range of 80. Moreover, *Tesla* has 5 electric vehicles recorded in the data set, with the **most electric efficient** model being the *Model S* with an electric range of **337**. The closest competitor to TESLA is the Chevrolet Bolt EV made in 2017with an electric range of 238. 

* **How does the amount of electric vehicles with CAFV vary based on the city?**


* **How does the number of vehicles fluctuate per region?**


Overall, this project allows for Washington state car owners to make more informed decisions what vehicle type they choose to purchase and to identify trends in electric vehicle ownership geographically.Additionally this analysis may be used by policy makers to determine how Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility can be improved.
